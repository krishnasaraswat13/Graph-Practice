//used to detect shortest path in graph with negative weight cycles
//means if there is a negative weight cycle in the graph then also it will detect it and will give correct shortest path
//time complexity O(VE) where v is no of vertices and e is no of edges
//it only used in directed graph but if we want to use it in undirected then we should treat that graoh as directed by consider each edge as two directed edges
//it used in cyclic graphs also 

//it uses n-1 iterations and we relax the edges by updating distances //we use n-1 iteration bcz this is the maximum iteration to fill all distance in worst case
//it is used in detecting negative cycle as at max it will take n-1 iteration to fill minimum distance but if in nth iteration if it still reduce distance then it means negative cycle exists

//distance from the src and detect neg cycle if exist
